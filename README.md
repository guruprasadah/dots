## So, you want to reproduce my setup eh?? Here's how to do that :
### Step 1 : configs
 * copy the contents of the .config folder into your XDG_CONFIG_HOME (usually .config)
 * copy contents of .icon folder into .icons folder in your home directory - and set the font
 * copy usr/local/bin/ contents (*from repo*) into your usr/local/bin directory
 * create a directory called walls in your Pictures folder and place nagisa-best.png inside. (*you may change this location in i3 config - just look for feh --bg-scale*)
 * install Comic Mono font (*google how to install*)

### Step 2 : deps
* install :
   * kitty
   * i3-gaps
